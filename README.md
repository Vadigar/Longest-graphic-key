# Longest-graphic-key
This project was created to find the strongest graphic key on android.
We define the complexity of the key by its length.
The graphic key consists of 9 vertices, each vertex can be traversed only once, if an edge passes through a vertex, it is considered already visited.
Let's number all the vertices from 0 to 8, then the key will be determined by the permutation of numbers from 0 to 8.

  6   7   8
  
  3   4   5 
  
  0   1   2
